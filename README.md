### 📝 Notes

- Usually the unit of measure is **unitless**; blocks are drawn in **1:1 scale** or SI units.
- If they are purposed for annotations, the blocks are to be scaled to the scale of the intended viewport
- All block geometry is created on the **"0" layer**.
- All text is set to "Standard"
- When inserted, blocks are placed on the **active/selected layer** in the drawing.
- **Pen attributes are set to "ByBlock"**, so blocks adopt the color and linetype of the color / layer assigned to the block.
